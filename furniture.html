<p>Iconic Irani cafes serving creamy chai and fresh samosas face extinction in Indian city.A lingering fragrance of bun maska (bread and butter), plates loaded with freshly cooked samosas and cups of piping hot and creamy Irani chai.

These are some of the sights you would typically find at a Persian-style cafe in India.

Popularly known as Irani cafes, these iconic restaurants - with their signature marble-topped tables, old-style clocks, chequered floors and a distinctive menu - have been a part of India's culture for more than 100 years.

And their influence has spread beyond India: Dishoom, one of London's most recognisable restaurant chains, was inspired by these cafes.

They came up in cities like Mumbai and Pune in the 18th and 19th centuries when there was an influx of Persian immigrants from Iran.

There's a third lesser known pocket of the country - the southern city of Hyderabad - where these cafes have been an intrinsic part of the local culture for decades.

But despite their many charms and the rich cultural heritage, the cafes of this city - like their counterparts in Pune and Mumbai - are on the verge of dying out, with owners blaming rising prices, competition from fast-food restaurants and changing consumer tastes.Hyderabad has the highest number of Irani cafes after Mumbai even today. That's because the city was a centre for Iranian trade in the late 19th Century.

Persian was widely spoken under the rule of a Muslim Nizam, or prince. The Niloufer café, located in the old quarters of the city, was actually named after the Nizam's daughter-in-law, an Ottoman princess.

This was also a period when parts of modern-day Pakistan were still in India, with Iran as its neighbour, making the country easily accessible to Persian traders.

Most of the families who moved to Hyderabad - and other Indian cities - came to escape persecution and famine back home. Some came in search of better jobs and business.

Their arrival coincided with colonial rule when the British were actively promoting a tea drinking culture in the country.

When the Iranians arrived, they brought their own style of making tea giving rise to a distinct Iranian chai culture in the cities.

In Iran, people would drink it without milk, consuming it with a sugar cube in the mouth. Indians, however, would add milk and cream to the tea for taste.

"At first, the tea was sold under the name Chai Khana and only Muslims drank it," Hyderabad-based historian Mohammed Safiullah says. "But soon, people from all religions caught on to its distinct flavour."

By the 20th Century, Irani cafes were present in every nook and corner of Hyderabad.

The customers would sip on the lip-smacking tea as they would spend hours chatting away at the coffee shops.At one time, Irani chai defined the café culture in Hyderabad, especially the old city. Introduced by settlers from Persia, the beverage and the places serving it evolved into an institution over time. At one time, Irani chai defined the café culture in Hyderabad, especially the old city.
